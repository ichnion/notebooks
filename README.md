# Introduction

Those notebooks were created by **Gawen MONNOT** and translated to Japanese by **Satoshi IIDA**, from [Georepublic Japan](https://georepublic.info/en/).

They were made at the request of Tokyo and Keio universities and are used as course material in data visualization.

This work is a part of the [Ichnion project](http://ichnion.code4myself.org/).

All the content is built on the exploitation of data from [Google Takeout services](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).

For the purpose of the presentation, those notebooks use anonymous Google Takeout data. To apply the code to your own data, you will need to replace every `PATH_TO_YOUR_FILE` variables by the path to where your data is stored on your device.

Below, you will find the list of required installations to fully run the notebooks:

- Python and Jupyter Notebook. We recommend you to install the [Anacadonda ecosystem](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
- [excavator](https://github.com/ichnion/excavator), a command line tool developed by Georepublic.
- [folium](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/folium)
- [reverse_geocoder](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/reverse_geocoder)


# Content 


There are two different folders. 

The first one `(1) Introduction notebooks` was made for students who are not comfortable with Jupyter Notebook, Python and its libraries. It contains notebooks that quickly explain those concepts.

The second one `(2) Google Takeout Data Notebook` contains notebooks where Google Takeout Data can be visualized and exploited.
